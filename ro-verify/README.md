# Ro-Verify

A more sophisticated phishing attempt, part of a group stealing/selling and robux selling program where the scammer will trick you into providing login details as part of a fake oauth process

This system is a little more resistant to stupid inputs, and also doesn't have as much sitting visible to the browser

it also seems that they have some sort of automatic captcha completion (I think done serverside, but it's hard to tell, which is why I've attached the arkose js files they use)

In this case, the landing site was ro-verify.com and the malicious site was roblox.com.ag

(this also apparently isn't the first time roblox.com.ag was used in a roblox-based scam, some sort of login approval scam 3 months ago, don't have the details)
