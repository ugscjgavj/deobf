# RoTemplate deobfuscation

Some random Roblox scam from February 2024 that I'm deobfuscating post-mortem out of interest and archival purposes. I know no details about how this scam worked or was advertised.

The source of this was found accidentally at https://phishcheck.me/281754/details while searching for other scripts

This is one of those more childish scam scripts, with mature names like the html element id "GetNiggasEmail" and the function "omggay", so I'm not going to bother analysing it in-depth
